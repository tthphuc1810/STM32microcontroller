# Embedded Programming on STM32F103C8T6 Blue Pill ARM Cortex-M3 Board

## Introduction

* This project is used as a final assignment for the Microcontroller course.
* The project is developed using C language and Hardware Description Language (HDL).
* STM32Cube IDE is utilized for mapping pins with the actual circuit board.
* Environmental factors such as temperature and humidity are collected using the DHT11 module. Data transmission is performed using the SIM900 module with attached AT commands.
* A cloud project is created on ThingSpeak.

### Supervisor

* Dr. Le Duc Hung - Faculty of Electronics and Telecommunications, University of Science - VNU-HCM
